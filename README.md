SQL Project: Relational Sales Database Simulation 

I recently completed a hands-on SQL project focused on designing and querying a realistic sales database from scratch
— covering everything from schema design to data analysis.
___________________________________________________________________________
🧩 Project Scope:

✔️ This simulated sales environment includes the following core tables:

✔️ customers – personal data, country, and engagement score

✔️ employees – department-wise employee data with self-referencing hierarchy

✔️ products – item catalog with category and pricing

✔️ orders – live transaction records

✔️ orders_archive – archived historical data for longitudinal analysis
___________________________________________________________________________
🔍 Key SQL Concepts Applied

✔️ Relational schema design with foreign keys and indexes
✔️ Complex JOIN operations across multiple tables
✔️ Aggregations and metrics (total sales, order counts, shipping delays)
✔️ Nested subqueries and derived tables
✔️ UNION, UNION ALL, GROUP BY, HAVING, DATEDIFF, and time-based filters
✔️ Comparison of active and archived datasets

📊 Sample Analytical Queries

Total sales per customer

Number of orders handled by each salesperson

Orders shipped in February 2025

Orders with >10-day shipping duration

Employees earning above average

Customers with more than two orders

🎯 This project helped me strengthen my understanding of relational database systems, data modeling, and query optimization

💬 I’m always open to feedback or ideas to expand this project further — whether through views, stored procedures, data normalization
or BI dashboards in tools like Power BI or Tableau.
